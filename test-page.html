	<h1>Welcome to Career Tech</h1>

	<p>Great job creating your repository today on GitHub!</p>

	<p>A <em>repository</em> is just a fancy word for a <strong>folder</strong>.</p>

	<p>If you&apos;ve configured GitHub Desktop, you&apos;ll be able to make a copy of the repository you created on the GitHub site and save it to your computer.</p>

	<p>GitHub Desktop lets you save your work to the repository on your computer, and the files in repository on your computer are then synchronized with the corresponding files in the repository on the GitHub website.</p>

	<p>The process also works in reverse, i.e., you can add a file (or files) to your online GitHub repository and then use GitHub Desktop to pull those files -- and any changes you made to those files -- down to the repository on your personal computer.</p>

	<p>Please click the 'Open in Visual Studio Code' button in GitHub Desktop to open this page in VS Code.  Assuming you also installed the Live Server extension in VS Code, then click the words &quot;Go Live&quot; in the bottom right of your VS Code window to open your web page in your web browser.</p>

	<p>Send me an email and let me know if you were able to view this page from within VS Code (by clicking &quot;Go Live&quot; at the bottom of your VS Code window.)</p>
