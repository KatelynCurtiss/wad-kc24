	<h1>Welcome to Career Tech</h1>

	<p>Great job creating your repository today on GitHub.</p>

	<p>A <em>repository</em> is just a fancy word for a <strong>folder</strong>.</p>

	<p>If you&apos;ve configured GitHub Desktop, you&apos;ll be able to make a copy of the repository you created on the GitHub site and save it to your computer.</p>

	<p>GitHub Desktop lets you save your work to the repository on your computer, and the repository on your computer is then synchronized with the corresponding repository on the GitHub website.</p>

	<p>The process also works in reverse, i.e., you can add a file (or files) to your online GitHub repository and then use GitHub Desktop to pull those files down to the repository on your personal computer.</p>
